## Application for Python Image Crypter

#### Feel free to use

I have created a simple implementation of pure steganography in python
In my encrypt/decrypt scripts I'm changing/reading only the least important bit from each color of RGB pixel.


#### About AoPIC

Main file is app/main_app.py. 
There is still a lot to code in this project, but feel free to coment. 

Next milestone:
* Implement RSA encryption
* Add one more bit for hidden image on each pixel color. From 3bit-8colors to 6bit-64colors ! 
* Create nice UI 

_Version:_
_1.0_
