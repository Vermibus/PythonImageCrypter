# Application for Python Image Crypter

### Feel free to use

---
I have created a simple implementation of pure steganography in python

In my encrypt/decrypt scripts I'm changing/reading only the least important bit from each color of RGB pixel.

Next milestone:
* Implement RSA encryption
* Add one more bit for saving data ( on each color )

_Version:_
_1.0_
